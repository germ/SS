  \/\_____\\/\_____\  Based off http://friedspace.com/SDLTest.c use it if you need

       Hack On        
        Germ          This code is just a little hack to make experimentation
                      quick and easy. And yes the style is terrible. This was
                      just a quick little bit of code for personal use that a
                      friend wanted to see.
